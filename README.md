<h1>Purpose</h1>

The application allows you to master your typing skills.

<h1>What was it made in?<h1>

The application has been created in GTK library and C language.

<h1>The setup layer</h1>

At first, the application lets you choose the word letters range and awaits clicking the switch view button.

<h1>The training layer</h1>

Then it switches the view context to the next phase where, at the top of the application you can see a word to type which satisfies the previously defined range. Once the length of the text you put into the entry equals the length of the word to type, your input gets verified whether it was correct or incorrect. Then it calculates the accuracy of your entire attempt. This happens after every above check satisfaction within 60 second from the initial view of the window.

<h1>The summary layer</h1>

Finally, the application takes the user to the summary view, where you can find your best, average, worst words per second score for given mode. The application awaits to be either turned off or move back to the setup view.
